Your Project
------------

On the back-end,
- the app starts at `server.js`
- calls on the Spotify API for song searching, audio analysis, and audio features
- most of the data processing is found in `public/client.js`, as well as how we implemented the chord progression bubble chart

On the front-end,
- the app uses the Bootstrap framework and Chart.js for data visualization

This project was built on Glitch, a developer playground that lets you code a real web-app without the slow setup and deployment steps.
